/* Task 4 - getting the penny doubler working
Now it's time to get those pennies piling up! The DOUBLE EM! button is already hooked up to the handleClick function behind the scenes - you'll learn how to do this yourself soon! For now, your job is to write the code inside the function itself that manipulates the DOM to show a doubled amount of pennies on the page with each click.

The function handleClick currently looks like this...

function handleClick() {
  console.log("I'm just to prove it's working!");
}
Within the function...

ðŸ‘‰ Double the the value of the the pennies variable (already defined - look for it in the file!).âœ…

ðŸ‘‰ Use the pennies variable to update the textContent of the output tag to be ${pennies} pennies.âœ… */
//create function that doubles the value of the pennies variable when you click the button
//double value of pennies
// within the output tag, change the text inside to output

  pennies = pennies * 2;

5.1 - add more proof
ðŸ‘‰ Use JavaScript to create a paragraph element using the DOM. âœ…

ðŸ‘‰ Append your new paragraph as a child of the section element with the id "proof-section".âœ… */
